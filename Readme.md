## Overview

The House Price Prediction ML Model is built using a variety of Machine Learning techniques and regression algorithms. It takes into account numerous features of houses and provides an estimate of their market price. This model can be used for various real estate applications, including property valuation, investment decision-making, and market analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found in the `data` directory. It includes information about various houses, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant attributes.

## Features

The model considers a wide range of features for house price prediction, including:
- Number of bedrooms
- Square footage
- Location (longitude and latitude)
- Year built
- Number of bathrooms
- Lot size
- Garage size
- and more...

## Dependencies

To run the House Price Prediction ML Model, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (for model development)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the model for house price prediction, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (as mentioned in the Dependencies section).
3. Open a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment.
4. Load the dataset from the `data` directory.
5. Use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model.

## Model Training

The `train_model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook or script contains the code for training the house price prediction model. You can experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2). The evaluation results can be found in the `evaluation` directory.
